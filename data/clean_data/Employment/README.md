This csv file contains the number of clean energy employment (2018-2021), share of clean energy employment among all employment (2018-2021), and growth rate of clean energy employment (2018-2021) for 50 states and Washington D.C.  
  
Caveats:  
E2 only starts to record the number of clean energy employment for all state from 2019. For years before 2019, only the top 10 states have actual figures for clean energy employment. If this statistics is needed, the employment numbers for states with missing values are estimated by fitting a linear regression of employment data from 2019 to 2021. This model tends to over-estimate employment (especially for year 2017).
