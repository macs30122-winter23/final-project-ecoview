We track the number of Environmental Protection Bills each state proposed in congress and the votes each state casts for these bills from 2018 to 2021
The data are gathered by govtrack and the thme of each bill is already categorized
This data will be scraped from the website
For the number of bills proposed, we will generate a table that denotes the number of bills proposed and the share of total bills from each state for each year. For the votes casted, we will create a table that lists the proportion of yes-votes to all votes in a state for each bill and take the average of proportion of yes-votes in a year for each state
A issue with this data is that neither of the two measures alone could describe the state's political effort, so we collect data on both measures
