Hi, all!

We at EcoView are dedicated to exploring the relationship between political leaning and sustainability in each state of the United States. 

# Our Project

To achieve this goal, we have created a GitHub repository containing all the raw data and code used in our project. 

The repository is structured in the following way:


- [**Data**](https://github.com/macs30122-winter23/final-project-ecoview/tree/main/data)

  - raw_data

    - AQI(Air quality Index)
    - Bill
    - Emission
    - Employment
    - Energy_Efficiency_score
    - Electricity_Generation_ratio 
    - Political_leaning
    - State_population

  - clean_data

    - a concated tabel (master table) that aggregate all the data we use (.csv)
    - GOOD_DAY_RATIO
    - BILL
    - Emission_PER_CAPITAL
    - EMPLOYMENT
    - SHARE
    - GROW
    - Energy_Efficiency_score
    - Electricity_Generation_ratio 
    - Political_leaning

- [**Scripts**](https://github.com/macs30122-winter23/final-project-ecoview/tree/main/scripts)

  - Data_Collection (any operation on getting data)
  - Data_Visualization (any code on visualizing)
  - preprocess (any script that contribute to raw_data, clean_data and the master table)
  - analysis (any operation on the master table)

- [**Presentation**](https://github.com/macs30122-winter23/final-project-ecoview/tree/main/scripts)
